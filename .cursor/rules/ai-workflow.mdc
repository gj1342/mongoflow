# AI Workflow

Acronyms: PP=Project Planner, PM=PM, ARCH=Architect, DEV=Developer, QA=QA, SEC=Security, REV=Reviewer.

When user says PP, PM, ARCH, DEV, QA, SEC, or REV (or planning/implementation/security/review), read the relevant ai/ docs first.

- **Any task**: [ai/ARCHITECTURE.md](ai/ARCHITECTURE.md), [ai/RULES.md](ai/RULES.md)
- **PP / planning**: [ai/agents/PROJECT_PLANNER.md](ai/agents/PROJECT_PLANNER.md), TODO.md
- **PM**: [ai/agents/PM.md](ai/agents/PM.md)
- **ARCH**: [ai/agents/ARCHITECT.md](ai/agents/ARCHITECT.md)
- **DEV**: [ai/agents/DEVELOPER.md](ai/agents/DEVELOPER.md)
- **QA**: [ai/agents/QA.md](ai/agents/QA.md)
- **SEC**: [ai/agents/SECURITY.md](ai/agents/SECURITY.md)
- **REV**: [ai/agents/REVIEWER.md](ai/agents/REVIEWER.md)

## Key Constraints

- TODO.md is the source of truth for scope and status.
- Layered architecture: models -> repositories -> services -> controllers -> routes.
- SOLID and DRY principles apply.
- No comments allowed in code.
- TypeScript strict mode.
- Centralized error handling via AppError and errorHandler.
